# __Growth Mindset__

The article states that a growth mindset is synonymous with “a love of learning”, but I found it to match the idea of being “a lifelong learner” instead. A mindset is a set of beliefs that guide an individual through life, it is something that requires practice, patients, and determination. At first is can be challenging and require additional effort but with time it can become natural and apart of the way we approach situations. That’s why lifelong learner seemed to match the growth mindset better, rather than loving to learn which seems like it could end up with a hyperfocused mindset rather than an approach to life.

The article presents thing that everyone will encounter in life and a different tool or technique to use when facing them. On the topic of challenges it says to embrace, I found this to be the most important ones for me in the article. I think knowing that challenges will arise and by accepting that concept, allows a person to skip over the why is this happening to me mindset and go right into how can I make this a strength or resolve this problem so it never reoccurs and impacts my future self. The writer does a great job addressing what is probably the most common approach when faced with challenges which is avoidance, but continues on to show why avoiding a challenge is harmful to growth. The moment someone chooses avoidance they instantly limit their full potential.

Next the writer discusses obstacles and shows how "persistence" is the key to success when approaching the world with a growth mindset. I found the article funny because the way I handle obstacles is to actually leverage the so called “instant gratification monkey”. You may have heard of the saying “How do you eat an elephant” and the answer is “one bite at a time”.  When faced with a large obstacle persistance is a key factor but one thing I attempt to do is to take a moment and break the obstacle down into more manageable pieces. Once the task is broken down it is no longer one large hard to complete task but rather many simpler and more achievable ones. 

Next, effort is discussed, and they refer to this as “no pain no gain”, and once again I feel the description is slightly skewed. I believe a better answer would be “you get out what you put in”. I say this because pain has a negative tone, and is associated with avoidance, but when looking at effort as an investment in one’s future self, it makes an individuals mindset more positive rather than negative.

Coming from a military background criticism is something I am very familiar with and it can be very effective or very harmful depending on the mindset of all the parties involved. One tool I found to make criticism effective is to have a sustain and improve mindset. So, as you look back at your work document the things you believe you did right and some actions you want to avoid or improve upon the next time you do that task again. As people go over your work take notes in that same way capturing what should be sustained and what should be improved whether the reviewer chooses to brief you in that fashion or not. 

Success of others is incredibly important; it is an opportunity to learn what worked for them and the challenges they may have faced along the way. It is important to remember that the success of others does not mean that you failed or your achievements are any less. Learning from each other and being open to their ideas allows for a work environment to evolve and grow together and ensures no one is left behind or in the dark.
